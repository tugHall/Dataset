This is a subset of dataset for simulations with mutation rate equls 10^-08 (file database_MODELS.txt.zip). 
Other parameters are in the Initial_param.zip file. 
Results of simulations are in the database_MODELS.txt file. 
Analyze_MODELS.txt file contains the statistics of simulations for different models and conditions.


Max time step = 200,
Criteria to stop simulation N_max = 10^6 cells.
