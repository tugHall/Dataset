Dataset used the cell-based code (tugHall ver.1.2)
These data were used for paper [Bioinformatics, 36(11), 2020, 3597â€“3599 doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa182].

Max timestep = 100;
criteria to stop simulation was N_max = 10^5 cells.

The results are maximum of VAF for each gene (APC, KRAS, TP53 and PIK3CA) in the simulation. 
Only model "STRONG" was used with 1000 initial primary cells.
