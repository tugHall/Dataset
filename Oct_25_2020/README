This is a subset of dataset for simulations with mutation rate equls 4*10^-08 (file database_MODELS.txt.zip). 
Other parameters are in the Initial_param.zip file. 
Results of simulations are in the database_MODELS.txt file. 
Analyze_MODELS.txt file contains the statistics of simulations for different models and conditions.


Max time step = 200,
Criteria to stop simulation N_max = 10^6 cells.

File data_base_MODELS.txt.zip is splitted by 2. To merger in terminal, please, type command:

cat data_base_MODELS.txt.zip.aa data_base_MODELS.txt.zip.ab  >  data_base_MODELS.txt.zip

and after just unzip it.
